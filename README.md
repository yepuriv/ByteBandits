The problem we aim to address is complex. Firstly, we recognize the logistical challenges and
financial constraints that individuals face when furnishing their living spaces, especially in
today's increasingly mobile society. Many people, including students, professionals, and
individuals in transitional phases, often find themselves in need of furniture but hesitate to invest
in costly purchases due to uncertainties regarding their future living arrangements.
Additionally, the traditional model of furniture ownership entails burdens such as transportation,
assembly, maintenance, and eventual disposal, which can be difficult and expensive. Moreover,
for students specifically, the need for furniture is often temporary and tied to academic semesters
or lease durations, making traditional purchasing options impractical and financially
burdensome.

Therefore, it's obvious that we need a solution that lets you get the required furniture for the
required amount of time, without any hassle. This solution should provide flexibility,
affordability, and convenience that suits different lifestyles and timeframes.
Q4: What is the idea to solve the problem?
Our solution is to develop OakRentals, a user-friendly furniture rental application designed to
meet the needs of individuals and students alike. With OakRentals, users can easily select
through a wide selection of furniture items, choosing what they need for the exact duration they
need it, whether it's for a short-term residence, a semester-long stay, or any other specific
timeframe they require.

We aim to offer a diverse catalog of furniture options, catering to various tastes and budgets,
ranging from essential items to high-end selections. This ensures that users can find the perfect
furnishings to suit their needs without the burden of long-term ownership commitments and the
associated costs.

By providing this flexible and affordable solution, OakRentals not only simplifies the process of
furnishing living spaces but also promotes sustainability by encouraging the reuse of furniture
items. Additionally, it negates the logistical hurdles often encountered when acquiring and
disposing of furniture, especially for individuals with transient lifestyles or temporary housing.
